# My Chrome Extensions
This repository publishes the Chrome extension I created.

# Compatibility
It should work on other Chromium-based browsers (such as Edge) as well as Chrome.

# How to install
*The method is the same for all extensions, and I'll explain it in Chrome.*
1. Open the extensions page.
1. Enable "Developer mode".
1. Select "Load unpackaged extension".
1. Select the extension you downloaded.
1. Done!
