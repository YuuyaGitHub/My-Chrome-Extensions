# My Chrome Extensions
This repository publishes the Chrome extension I created.

# Distribution
The extensions distributed here require application (a $5 registration fee is required), so they are not distributed through the Chrome Web Store.

# Compatibility
It should work on other Chromium-based browsers (such as Edge) as well as Chrome.
